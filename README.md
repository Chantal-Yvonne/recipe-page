### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
With this challenge I have learnt how to start with small screens to create  simple layout and to add complexity at larger breakpoints.I have also learned how to use counter-reset,counter-increment, and counter(name) to create custom numbering. 

### Continued development

I will continue to practice the mobile first approach and enhance layout complexity only when needed
